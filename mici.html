    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>700 g Beef</li>
        <li>300 g mutton</li>
        <li>250-350 ml Bone soup</li>
        <li>22 g Salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated dried thyme</li>
        <li>5-6 juniper berries</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coriander beans</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coriander beans</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>5-7 cloves of large garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, cut the beef into cubes. Cut the pork breast into pieces and place it next to the beef.</li>
        <li>(COMMENT: Are we assuming everyone has a meat grinder? If not, give an alternative of using minced meat?)</br>
            Put in the finest cutting plate (with smaller holes) in the meat grinder and put all the meat through it, including the garlic cloves.
        </li>
        <li>Crush all the spices (except the baking soda) in a pestle and mortar, making a floury and flavorful powder.</li>
        <li>(COMMENT: What happens to the baking soda?)Prepare a teaspoon of baking soda.</li>
        <li>Put the minced meat into a food processor (equipped with the dough kneading hook).</li>
        <li>
            The mixture needs to be kneaded hard for a few minutes. The machine will make your work easier. You can also do it manually.</br> In fact it would be good to call the man of the house to work a little on these nice little mici that go so well with cold beer. </br>Okay, this is true only for large quantities… at 1-2 kg we women can manage.
        </li>
        <li>Put the ground spices and baking soda over the meat and start the food processor.</li>
        <li>At first, the homemade mici paste is very thick and hard to knead. Gradually add cold bone soup (or cold water) and knead everything for about 7-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>The mixture becomes fluffy and soft.</li>
        <li>Do not put in all the liquid if you feel that 250 or 300 ml is enough.</li>
        <li>Put the mixture into a clean bowl, cover it with plastic or aluminum foil and put it in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Make into cylindircal shape</li>
        <li>Stick them on the barbeque and enjoy</li>
